      "controversy": "In a claim by the Mumbai Police in August 2020, Badhsha paid Rs. 72 lakh to gain additional views on his music video \"Pagal Hai.\" According to Badshah, the music video received 75 million views on the first day of its release; surpassing the previous records set by Taylor Swift and the Korean boy band BTS. However, this claim was rejected by Google. While revealing this wrong practice by Badshah to Mumbai Mirror, Nandkumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, said, \"The singer confessed that he wanted to set a world record for most number of viewers in 24 hours on YouTube. That is why he paid Rs 72 lakh to this company.” Later, the rapper denied these allegations and said, \"Following the summons, I have spoken to the Mumbai Police. I have aided the officials in their investigation by cooperating and carrying out the due diligence on my part. I’ve categorically denied all the allegations levelled against me and made it clear that I was never involved in such practices, nor do I condone them. The investigation procedure is being executed in accordance with the law and I have complete faith in the authorities, who are handling this matter. I’d like to thank all those who have conveyed their concern to me. It means a lot to me.”"

Since Maharashtra laws allow only a farmer to buy agricultural land, the actor showed the Pune district authorities a certificate from the then Barabanki district magistrate, Ramashankar Sahu, saying Amitabh was a farmer because he owned farmland in the district.

Upon checking why this sudden move - it was revealed that when Mr. Bachchan became associated with the brand, he wasn’t aware that it falls under surrogate advertising. Mr. Bachchan has terminated the contract with the brand, has written to them his termination and has returned the money received for the promotion."

      "controversy": "On 15 September 2021, a series of raids was carried out by the Income Tax Department at various premises related to Sood including Mumbai, Nagpur, and Jaipur. Reportedly, these raids meant to probe a real estate deal and some other financial transactions related to Sood. Later, the Central Board Of Taxes alleged that the actor had evaded tax of Rs. 20 crore. After Sood and a Lucknow-based infrastructure group was raided by the Income Tax Department, it was found that the actor routed his “unaccounted income in the form of bogus unsecured loans from many bogus entities.” The agency also accused him of violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while raising donations from abroad. According to the tax authority, the actor's charity foundation, which he founded in July 2020, raised Rs. 18.94 crore in donations from April 2021 till September 2021, but it spent only Rs. 1.7 crore in relief work, and the remaining Rs. 17 crore was lying with the foundation unutilised. Following the allegations, the actor, on 20 September 2021, took to social media to share a post that read - <strong>“You don’t always have to tell your side of the story, time will. I have pledged myself to the service of the people of India with all my strength and heart. Every rupee in my foundation is awaiting its turn to save a precious life and reach the needy. In addition on many occasions, I have encouraged brands to donate my endorsement fees for humanitarian causes too, which keeps us going. I have been busy attending to a few guests, hence was unable to be at your service for the past few days. Here I am back again, in all humility, at your humble service for life. My journey continues.”"

  "description": "Abhishek Amitabh Bachchan (born 5 February 1976) is an Indian actor and film producer known for his work in Hindi films. Part of the Bachchan family, he is the son of actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan.\n      Bachchan made his acting debut in 2000 with J. P. Dutta's war film Refugee which was the fifth highest grosser of the year, and followed by starring in over a dozen films which were all critical and commercial failures. His first commercial successes came with the 2003 & 2004 action films Zameen and Dhoom, which changed his career prospects. Bachchan went on to earn critical appreciation for his performances in the dramas Yuva (2004), Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), which won him three consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him the second and only actor after Dilip Kumar to win 3 Filmfare awards consecutively. In 2005, he won the Stardust Award for Actor of the Year for his performance in Yuva, and in 2007, he portrayed a character loosely based on Dhirubhai Ambani in Mani Ratnam's drama film Guru, which earned him critical acclaim and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor."

Acknowledged as one of the finest actresses in Indian cinema,[2] she has starred in more than 180 films and is the recipient of several accolades, including one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards. She has often played strong and complicated female characters—from fictional to literary—in both mainstream and independent films.

(We have forgotten the real meaning behind rituals and festivals and have turned them into a spectacle). Qurbani ek bahut ahem festival hai… it means to sacrifice. A goat was then a prime source of food, and there were many who went hungry. So you had to, in a way, sacrifice something dear to you and distribute it to people.\" His comments were criticized by the Muslim clerics. Irrfan in reply tweeted, \"Pls Bhaiyon, who r upset with my statement, either u r not ready to introspect or u r in a hurry to reach to a conclusion.\""

  "description": "Saif Ali Khan (born Sajid Ali Khan Pataudi on 16 August 1970) is an Indian actor and producer who works in Hindi films. The son of actress Sharmila Tagore and cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan, Khan made his acting debut in Yash Chopra's drama Parampara (1993), but achieved success with his roles in the romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari (both 1994). Khan's career prospect declined through much of the 1990s, and his biggest commercial success of the decade came with the ensemble family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). He rose to prominence with roles in two ensemble comedy-dramas—Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003)."

  "description": "Rani Mukerji (born 21 March 1978) is an Indian actress who works in Hindi films. Noted for her versatility, she is the recipient of multiple accolades, including seven Filmfare Awards. Mukerji has featured in listings of the highest-paid actresses of the 2000s. Although Mukerji was born into the Mukherjee-Samarth family, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. As a teenager she dabbled with acting by starring in her father Ram Mukherjee's Bengali-language film Biyer Phool and in the social drama Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat (both 1996). Mukerji had her first commercial success with the action film Ghulam (1998) and breakthrough with the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998). Following a brief setback, the year 2002 marked a turning point for her when she was cast by Yash Raj Films as the star of the drama Saathiya."

Doctors had removed 15 litres of pus from my stomach and just after it got cured, I lost my father. I had started losing my life. So, I went to Rishikesh and started making omelettes at a dhaba near the bank of Ganga. The dhaba owner told me I will have to wash 50 cups a day and I will get Rs 150. But then I thought I need money for my survival.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n          <p>In the same interview, the actor gave credit to director Rohit Shetty for his comeback in the film industry.

In between all this, Rohit Shetty called me and offered a role in All the Best. That’s when I decided to get back to work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>",

When I did become aware of it, I issued a statement clarifying my stand. And violence is wrong. If it is against a woman, it’s a heinous crime and perpetrators should be brought to justice and severe punishment should be given so that it sets an example. I don’t think that has happened.
